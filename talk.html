<h2> What Characterizes Impressionism?  </h2>
<!--paragraph-->
<p> Impressionism, both a genre of art and famous 19th-century art movement that first originated in Paris, became prominent during the late 1800s after initially facing severe criticism for its radical art styles. It later developed and influenced many other forms of media, bringing about impressionist music and impressionist literature. Impressionist paintings are

 by their thin brush strokes, emphasis on a light source, ordinary subject matter, and illusions of movement. Typical Impressionist paintings often depict natural landscapes or people, and depicted the perceptions of light and the effects of passing time. </p>

<h2> Controversy </h2>
<p> Initially, the "Impressionists" faced <a href="https://useum.org/exhibition/curated/Impressionism/Early-Criticism"> hostility</a> from the French conventional art community due to its unconventional style. French art was dominated by the Académie des Beaux-Arts, which preserved traditional French paintings of portraits, religious/historical subjects, etc. The Académie preferred the typical realistic paintings with precise, carefully blended strokes and toned down colors. They did not approve of the Impressionists' "gaudy", messy paintings of landscapes and still life. Thus, the Impressionists received scathing responses from critics. In fact, the name "Impressionist" was coined by critic Louis Leroy, who claimed that the Impressionist paintings were mere "impressions" of art, and that they were at most, unfinished sketches. </p>
